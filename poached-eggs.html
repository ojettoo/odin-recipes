        <p>Poached Eggs are a delicious addition to any breakfast table. In my humble opinion, a well cooked egg white, complemented by a runny yolk in the center, on top of a lightly toasted English muffin is one of the best ways to start the day!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>1 tsp champagne vinegar</ul>
        <ul>1/2 tsp salt</ul>
        <ul>2 fresh eggs</ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a bowl with water.</li>
            <li>Boil a saucepan of water, adding salt and the vinegar. Bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Crack your eggs into the simmering water. Make sure not to make a mess, try to crack slowly and close to the water so the egg doesn't spread out too far.</li>
            <li>After about 5 minutes, scoop out the eggs with a slotted spoon and place them in the ice water. Reheat for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Do your best to drain the poached eggs of excess water and then place on top of a buttered muffin. Enjoy!</li>
